<li>I am a fun of Japanese Anime. That is where I learned Japanese.</li>

<li>I have particiated NOIP 2007 when I was in high school. It is a national
competition on programming. I prepared for that using the online judge, <a
href="http://train.usaco.org/usacogate">USACO</a>, which assigned me with the ID
menie482, that I have been using since then. I posted my solutions <a
href="http://hi.baidu.com/bxnzbducrrbchkq">here</a>, in Chinese.</li>

<li>When I was in the age addicted to programming instead of research, I have
made a popular application on renren.com. Users can make up a certain pattern
(e.g. a heart shape) by their poses. My high school classmate, Chirr, helped me
with the illustrations (the lovely girl showing the pose below). My friend Azuis
helped me on the server-side.<br/>

Unfortunately we are unable to maintain it anymore. It is now offline.

<li>I received CPR training from Nanjing Red Cross. I am a trained Peer
Education instructor for AIDS prevention.</li>
<li>My hometown is Jinan, Shandong, China. I have also lived in Nanjing in
China, and Austin TX, Seattle WA in the US.</li>
